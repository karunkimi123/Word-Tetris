A javascript/jquery tetris-like game built to learn javascript. 

It requires the player to control the falling tetris blocks to construct anagrams for a given word. The word is four letter long, since, in tetris, there are four blocks. The player should try to contruct as many anagrams as possible. 

The game ends when the game window can no longer accomodate the falling tetris blocks. Additionally, one can pause, stop the game whenever one wishes to do so.
